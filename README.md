## Description
> This project was taking node, and creating an HTML to generate a team profile. Three team members Manager, Engineer, and Intern would all need to generate. I made my code as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible, meaning this code could easily be manipulated to add additional team members. The code also needed to pass through testing for a file of employees, manager, engineer, and intern.

## Installation
> I pulled the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package, aka ```package.json```, entered ```npm install``` , and then used the ```require``` method to narrow down to the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package.

## Contributions
> I would like to thank my tutor Corey Yates for her help with this assignment, and getting me to wrap my head around testing.  I would also like to thank Jose Centurion for talking me off the shelf when over whelmed with frustration, Matt Vandevort for always talking code with me, and Dominick Simone for being an absolute JavaScript wizard.  I could not have done it without you friends!
## Testing
> Testing was run using ```npm run test``` In order to ensure, all aspects of the application were working properly, I would continuously check each step of the way to make sure no error appeared, and many sure did.  I simply entered ```node index.js``` , then followed the prompts of questions within the terminal to make sure, each one showed within the Html, and showed up well.
